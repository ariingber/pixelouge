        Pixelogue is a two player matching game. Player One get set, and then hit the
        play button when you're ready. Match your puzzle to the computer's puzzle as fast as possible.
        At some point the computer may turn all red and hide its puzzle.  If you can't solve the puzzle hit the surrender key.
        If you can solve it, your time will be saved.  Now its Player Two's turn.  Who can solve the puzzle faster?
